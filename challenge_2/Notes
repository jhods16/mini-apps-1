Notes

The server must flatten the JSON hierarchy, mapping each item/object in the JSON to a single line of CSV report (see included sample output), where the keys of the JSON objects will be the columns of the CSV report.
You may assume the JSON data has a regular structure and hierarchy (see included sample file). In other words, all sibling records at a particular level of the hierarchy will have the same set of properties, but child objects might not contain the same properties. In all cases, every property you encounter must be present in the final CSV output.
You may also assume that child records in the JSON will always be in a property called `children`.

All strings:
	- first line is a list of comma-separated object keys 
	- each line after a list of comma-separated values for each key
	- for each child of the the current object


- tree structure, so can use recursion to traverse tree

Plan
*create package.json file
	- jquery
	- express

	1. Build basic structure of index.html
		- title
		- form
		- input textarea
		- submit button
		- result display area

	2. create a server in server.js using express
		- serve up index.html
		- report generation logic will be here

	3. in app.js
		- listen for click on submit
		- send data to server
			- use default browser behavior (not ajax)
		- receive data from server
		- display it on the page
