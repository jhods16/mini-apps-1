Master Plan

1. Design board
	- will have board element
	- with nested square elements 3 X 3
	- ids 1-9 for click handling
	- reset button
	- way to select player X or O

2. Functionality
	- On load, empty board
	- Player 'x' always goes first 
	- On click, place an X or O in square depending on player X or O clicking
	- if three Xs or Os in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are clicked 
		- player X or O wins
	- if all options exhausted, tie/draw
	- Reset Button
		-clears board (but does not reload page)
